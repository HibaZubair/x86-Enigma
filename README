Enigma is an x86 assembly program that replicates the behavior of the World War 2 German "Enigma" encryption machine.

It currently supports 3 rotors, but will support up to 5 in the future.

Notes:
* This code requires the Irvine32 library.
* This code uses rotors III, II, and I (in that order from right to left) and uses the "UKW B" reflector.
* enigmav2.asm contains automatic reverse rotor generation code, and allows for the potential to input custom rotors
* Please use enigma-staticrotors.asm to test if engimav2.asm crashes when you run it.
