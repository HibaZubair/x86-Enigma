Enigma is an x86 assembly program that replicates the behavior of the World War 2 German "Enigma" encryption machine.

The current version supports multiple pre-set rotors as well as allowing for user created rotors. It currently supports 3 rotors, but will support up to 5 in the future.

This code requires the Irvine32 library.
